Seasonal whispers, last farewells,
     Autumn’s beauty forever told
With paintbrushes and pastels,
    Leaf rubbings of pink and gold.

Autumn’s beauty forever told
     Through the eyes of a little girl.
Leaf rubbings of pink and gold,
     Among broad strokes, colors swirl.

Through the eyes of a little girl
    With paintbrushes and pastels,
Among broad strokes, colors swirl,
    Seasonal whispers, last farewells.
