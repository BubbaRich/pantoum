It all started with a packet of seeds,
     To be planted with tenderness and care,
At the base of an Oak, free from all weeds.
     They will produce such beauty and flare.

To be planted with tenderness and care,
     A cacophony of colorful flowers,
They will produce such beauty and flare.
     With an aroma that can continue for hours.

A cacophony of colorful flowers,
     Bright oranges with yellows and reds,
With an aroma that can continue for hours,
     Delivered from their fresh flower beds.

Bright oranges with yellows and reds,
     At the base of an oak, free from all weeds,
