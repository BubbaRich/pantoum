{}World War II Pantoum
Remember those who died for us
They did not die in vain
They gave their lives and their trust
So atrocities of war are never again

They did not die in vain
Wear a poppy each November
So atrocities of war are never again
We must never forget, but remember

Wear a poppy each November
Honour those so brave
We must never forget, but remember
Our freedom they did pave

Honour those so brave
They gave their lives and their trust
Our freedom they did pave
Remember those who died for us.
