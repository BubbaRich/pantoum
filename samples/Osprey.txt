O, sleek and beauteous hunter
Who deftly takes to wing
And tears her prey asunder,
A victory cry she sings.

Who deftly takes to wing
This chilly, salty morn?
A victory cry she sings
As this new day is born.

This chilly salty morn
A seahawk silently dives,
As this new day is born,
To feed three brand new lives.

A seahawk silently dives
And tears her prey asunder
To feed three brand new lives,
O, sleek and beauteous hunter.
