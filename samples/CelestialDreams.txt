Moonbeams creamy as pie
Racing across the night
On a journey into the sky
Dreams seeking celestial light

Racing across the night
Past Venus waking from sleep
Dreams seeking celestial light
Cast into the dark so deep

Past Venus waking from sleep
To Saturn's expanding rings
Cast into the dark so deep
Catching a ride on angel's wings

To Saturn's expanding rings
On a journey into the sky
Catching a ride on angel's wings
Moonbeams creamy as pie
